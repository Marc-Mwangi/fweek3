In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you. How do we make sure that you use your 1 minute to actually say something meaningful?The objective of this project is to create a site where users can log in, sign up, post and view other users pitches

I used visual studio to code the project using mostly HTML, CSS for front end, Python's Flask for backend functions and SQLAlchemy to create databsese to store user information
